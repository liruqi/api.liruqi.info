    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>
        This Terms of Service document (the “Terms”) outlines the terms and conditions of use of the VPN services (the “Services” or “Service”) provided by Beijing Qiyi Technology Company Ltd. (“Mume Red”). These Terms also govern the use of and access to Mume’s content (the “Content”), which includes the Mume website (the “Site”), applications (the “Apps”), and any software provided by Mume (the “Software”). 
    </p>

<p>
The product-specific details sections provide additional information relevant to particular Mume products. This statement applies to the Mume products listed below, as well as other Mume products that display this statement. References to Mume products in this statement include Mume services, websites, apps, software and devices.
</p>

<h3> 1. Acceptance </h3>
By accessing the Content or Services, you are agreeing on behalf of yourself or those you represent (“you”) to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms in their entirety. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and Mume. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you may not use our Services.
<h3>
    2. Modification 
</h3>

Mume may update the Terms from time to time without notice. If you continue to use Mume’s Services, Content, Site, Apps, or Software after these changes take effect, then you agree to the revised Terms. The current version of the Terms is available on the Site. You understand and agree that it is your obligation to review these Terms from time to time in order to stay informed on current rules and obligations. Notification on any core changes to the Terms will be provided to subscribers through an email message or update to the Site. Your use of the Content or Services following the changes to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changed Terms. 

<h3>
    3. Privacy Policy 
</h3>
Mume is committed to your privacy and does not collect or log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries from Subscribers connected to our VPN. During your registration, we may collect some sensitive personal information, such as your email address and payment information. We only collect information that are necessary for the proper delivery of the Site and Services.

For the sake of clarity and transparency, we have placed all information related to data collection in a separate document known as the Privacy Policy, which is available on the Site. Please review the Privacy Policy in its entirety to get a clear understanding of how we handle your sensitive data. 
<h3>
    4. Subscriptions 
</h3>
Mume Services are available to you upon registration on the Site. By subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber (“Subscriber”) for the period you have elected. A full list of subscription plans and pricing is available on the Site. Mume reserves the right to amend subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on the Site or sent via email. Any changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriber’s current subscription period and will become effective upon subscription renewal. Subscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple third-party payment companies.

When supported by your payment method, plans renew automatically by default at the completion of the billing term. By default, the renewal term is for the same duration as the billing term for the original subscription. The subscription fee will be charged automatically to the payment method you last selected. If you would like to discontinue automatic renewal, you may sign in to the Site and turn off auto-renewal. By default, auto-renewal is turned on when you use a payment method that supports auto-renewal (such as a credit card or Paypal), and turned off when you use a payment method that does not support auto-renewal (such as bitcoin).

Each paid subscription grants you one (1) license to use on five (5) different devices at any given time. If you want to use the Services on more than five devices at a time, then you can either (i) use Mume on your router, (ii) purchase additional subscription plans, or (iii) purchase additional licenses through the ‘volume licensing’ option. For more information on ‘volume licensing’ program, please contact Support. 
<h3>
    5. Refund Policy 
</h3>
You may cancel your account with a full refund within 30 days of your initial purchase (“Money Back Guarantee”).

Refunds beyond the 30-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole discretion of Mume, if a Subscriber can demonstrate that the Service was not available or usable during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact Mume to resolve the issue. In this case, Mume may provide the Subscriber with a pro-rata refund of service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable.

Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days, and are made to the original form of payment used for purchase. All refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency or bitcoin.
